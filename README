JRuby SWT Cookbook
==================

JRuby and SWT is a great platform for writing cross-platform desktop applications. This repo contains 
examples of how to get started.

You will need to run these examples with JRuby. Get it from jruby.org.

API Docs
--------

The apidocs.tar.gz file contains SWT API reference docs. Untar the file and open apidocs/index.html in 
your browser. The comments in all the examples refers to files in these docs. They are the Java api, however
JRuby does a great job of interfacing with Java, so you can usually just call into them as if they were Ruby 
classes and methods.
